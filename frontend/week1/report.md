-->  Yes, it follows a tree structure as you can see that there are multiple div elements inside a single div element.

--> editing properties of elements change the way the page looks, like you can change font color, background color, the margin and padding spaces, further you can change the width between two lines of text.
    Moreover, you can change the height width of each div element. Thus the layout changes for each property we change.

--> Selecting an element and storing it inside a variable gives us the freedom to manipulate and print the data.
    Like using .value we can display the value of the text inputted and we can change the text also.
    We can also find the size of the text and then change it.
    This way using queryselector we have selected a particular element then we can proceed to manipulate this so-called element to our wish.

--> by disabling cache we can see a lot more requests. disabling the cache means that the data has to be imported each time for each operation as we have disabled temporary storage. This means a lot more calls than expected. disabling chache will also increase the time taken to load.
    throttling means that the internet is purposefully slowed hence it will take much longer time to load all the necessary data. If we click on no throttling the page gets reloaded pretty fast but if we switch to slow 3g we can see the page taking significantly longer time to load.
